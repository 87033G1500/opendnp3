Overview
========

Opendnp3 is a portable, scalable, and rigorously tested implementation 
of the DNP3 (www.dnp.org) protocol stack written in C++11. The library 
is designed for high-performance applications like many concurrent TCP
sessions or huge device simulations. It also embeds very nicely on Linux.

Language bindings are available. Consult the documentation.
