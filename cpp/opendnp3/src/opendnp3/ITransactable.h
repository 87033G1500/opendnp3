/**
    A Transaction is a group of point Updates that occur together.
	This is necessary because often times a single event will cause many values
	to change and that should be handled as a group so the data isn't unecessarily
	inconsistant. One example is a "master alarm" flag that is a summary of specific alarms,
	if we couldn't group the updates toegether we might see the master alarm flag turn on
	before any of the specific alarms had activated. Grouping the updates together also leads
	to more effecient communications because large chunks of data get transmitted at a time and
	we don't get into the pathelogical case of sending one update at a time.

	\section Usage
	\code
	  IDataObserver* pDataObserver; // usually kept as a member on a class
	  Transaction tr(pDataObserver);
	  Analog a;
	  a.SetValue(33);
	  a.SetToNow();
	  a.SetQuality(AQ_ONLINE);
	  pDataObserver.Update(a, 2);
