/**
	A generic interface that defines a notification function. Modeled loosly on a lock
	type interaction. Generally used for the multi-threaded observer pattern to indicate
	that a shared _thread_safe_ object has had a change occur. The application then knows
	that it needs to look at that shared object which it can do immediatley or at some point
	in the future (ie. when the "application" thread is ready).

	It is critical to remember that the calls to Notify() can potentially come from any thread!
